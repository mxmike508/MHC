## 👥 User Experience Vision

### Current Development Workflow (Pain Points)
```
Developer ➜ VS Code ➜ Export JSON ➜ Manual n8n Import ➜ Test ➜ Debug ➜ Repeat
                     ↑_____________Session Loss_____________↑
```

### Target MCP-Enabled Workflow
```
Developer ➜ Bob AI Chat ➜ "Create workflow for X" ➜ Live n8n Deployment ➜ Instant Testing
                       ↘ Auto-GitHub Commit ➜ Persistent Context ➜ Continuous Development
```

### User Stories

**As a Developer, I want to:**
- Say "Create a new webhook workflow for processing customer data" and have it deployed to n8n instantly
- Ask "Debug the authentication issue in my AI Router" and have Bob analyze the live workflow
- Request "Commit these changes to GitHub" and have version control handled automatically
- Start a new session and immediately continue where I left off without context loss

**As a Project Manager, I want to:**
- Review development progress through conversational interface
- Understand system architecture without technical deep-dives
- Track changes and deployments through integrated reporting
