# STAGING Working Set

Use this folder as the small, quiet corner of the repo that only contains what you are actively changing for the next test run. It keeps noise down for you and for any AI assistant.

Suggested contents during this phase:
- UI: `Chat_8_V8.0_STAGING.html` (a copy or minimal variant you’re testing)
- Workflow JSON: a single staging workflow (e.g., `Master_Workflow_v8_x_STAGING.json`)
- Notes: small `CHANGELOG.md` with 1‑2 lines per change.

Tips:
- Keep original large files in `BAK/` or `_archive/` and avoid opening them unless necessary.
- When sharing context with a new assistant, point them first to `docs/bootstrap_v2.md` and then to this folder.
